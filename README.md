# House Price Prediction Project

## Overview
This project aims to predict house prices using machine learning techniques. It analyzes various factors that influence the sale price of a house and builds predictive models to estimate prices accurately.

## Problem Statement
The goal is to develop a model that can predict house prices based on features such as living area, number of bedrooms, location, etc. This prediction will assist home buyers, sellers, and real estate agents in making informed decisions.

## Dataset
The project utilizes the "House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques" dataset, obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data). It includes a training set with features and sale prices for houses, as well as a test set for evaluation.

## Approach
1. **Data Exploration and Cleaning:** 
   - Analysis of data distributions, missing values, and outliers.
   - Cleaning data by removing duplicates, handling missing values, and treating outliers.
  
2. **Feature Engineering:** 
   - Creating new features such as house age from the 'YearBuilt' feature.
   - Encoding categorical variables into numerical values.

3. **Model Building:**
   - Building multiple regression models using algorithms like Lasso, ElasticNet, Gradient Boosting, etc.
   - Evaluating model performance using cross-validation and RMSLE metric.
  
4. **Ensemble Learning:**
   - Implementing Stacking Averaged Models to combine predictions from multiple base models for improved accuracy.
   - Fine-tuning hyperparameters and selecting the best-performing models.

5. **Model Deployment:**
   - Saving the trained model for future use and deployment.

## Usage
1. **Requirements:** 
   - Python 3.x
   - Required libraries: NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, etc. (install using `pip install -r requirements.txt`)

2. **Instructions:**
   - Clone the repository to your local machine.
   - Install the required dependencies.
   - Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script to execute the project.
